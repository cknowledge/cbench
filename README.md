## Introduction

cBrain is our attempt to create a cross-platform client 
connected with the [open cKnowledge.io portal](https://cKnowledge.io)
to support collaborative and reproducible benchmarking,
optimization and co-design of deep tech systems (AI, ML, quantum, IoT).

cBrain is also a wrapper around the [low-level CK SDK](https://cKnowledge.io)
to simplify the user experience.

## Platform support:
